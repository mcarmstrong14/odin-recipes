    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Toum is a super garlicy sauce that's perfect for falafel wraps.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups sunflower oil, avocado oil or canola oil, chilled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup garlic cloves peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ice cold water divided</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before you begin, place your oil in the freezer or refrigerator so that it is chilled, but still liquid. While the oil chills, remove the ends from your garlic cloves, split them in half and remove any green layers from inside. In a food processor, combine garlic cloves, salt, 1/4 cup of the lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the ice cold water.</li>
        <li>Process until smooth, then stop and scrape the sides of the food processor with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Turn the food processor back on and drizzle the chilled oil through the top as SLOWLY as possible, one cup at a time. If you don't have a steady hand I suggest putting the oil in a squeeze bottle and drizzling it in that way. After each cup of oil, add 1 tbsp each of the lemon juice and cold water.</li>
        <li>Only add oil until you've reached the texture you desire - you may only need 3 1/2 cups to achieve the proper texture. The final result should resemble a soft mayonnaise. This recipe makes about 5 cups of sauce, a serving is calculated as roughly 2 tablespoons. Store toum in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This recipe makes a pretty big batch, but it should keep for up to 4 weeks and it can be used on so many things.</li>
    </ol>
